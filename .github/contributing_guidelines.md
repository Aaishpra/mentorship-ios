# Welcome to Mentorship iOS Project.

We welcome anyone to contribute to this Open Source Project.

## Contribution Guidelines

1. Pick an open issue from the [issue list](https://github.com/anitab-org/mentorship-ios/issues) and claim it in the comments. After approval fix the issue and send us a pull request (PR).  
2. Or you can create a new issue. A community member will get back to you and, if approved, you can fix the issue and send a pull request.  
3. Please go through our issue list first (open as well as closed) and make sure the issue you are reporting does not replicate an issue already reported. If you have issues on multiple pages, report them separately. Do not combine them into a single issue.  
4. All the PRâ€™s need to be sent to the appropriate branch (usually "develop").  

## Avoid the following mistakes!

1. Fix a new issue and submit a PR without reporting and getting it approved at first.  
2. Fix an issue assigned to someone else and submit a PR before the assignee does.  
3. Report issues which are previously reported by others. (Please check the both open and closed issues before you report an issue).  
4. Suggest completely new features in the issue list. (Please use the mailing list/zulip channel for these kinds of suggestions. Use issue list to suggest bugs/features in the already implemented sections.
